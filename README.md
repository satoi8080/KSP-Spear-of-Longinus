# KSP - Spear of Longinus

## Introduction

This is a fan-made Kerbal Space Program MOD of Neon Genesis Evangelion inspired by the official [20th anniversary plan](https://readyfor.jp/projects/evangelion).

But we are faster than the official plan XD. (I wrote this in 2015 and  after that the official plan was canceled due to insufficient funds)

This mod includes a Spear of Longinus part and a Nerv flag.
